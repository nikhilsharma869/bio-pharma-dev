There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;CALL BAA:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Periodically over the period of this BAA, proposal call announcements (CALLS) may be issued in FedBizOps under BAA-RWK-14-0001 to request proposals for specific topics areas. Proposals in response to the CALLS will be accepted as specified in the individual CALLS. Offerors should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended or CALLS are issued.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This acquisition is unrestricted. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all or any part of this solicitation. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541712 (for Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), and the small business size standard is 500 employees (1000 employees for Space Vehicles and Guided Missiles, their propulsion units, their propulsion unit parts, and their auxiliary equipment and parts, 1000 employees for Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Aircraft Engine Parts, and1500 employees for Aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Occasionally, AFRL/RW will have more specific research interests or topics that warrant specific attention. Under those circumstances, a specific BAA will be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding availability, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Under some circumstances, we expect that narrowly focused proposals for specific research interests under the 18 research areas outlined in this BAA may be required during the time of this open announcement. Under those circumstances, proposal call announcements (CALLS) may be issued in FedBizOps under BAA-RWK-2014-0001 to request proposals for specific topic areas. These subsequent CALLS will contain specific objectives and descriptions of the specific topic area to be addressed, anticipated period of performance, information peculiar to the specific topic area, and the expected dollar range for proposals received under a CALL. Proposals in response to a BAA CALL will be determined acceptable as specified in the actual CALL.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;AFRL/RW contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Offerors contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/RW should carefully examine this BAA, and are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/RW technical Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;AFRL/RW is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Weapons Program Offices. There are three divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&amp;amp;D). They are the Ordnance Division, the Strategic Planning and Integration Division, and the Weapon Engagement Sciences Division.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;ORDNANCE DIVISION (RWM)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Ordnance Division (RWM) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development research of fuzes, damage mechanisms, and energetic materials for air launched munitions for use with a full array of launch platforms including fighter, bomber, and Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV). Recent AF Core Functional Master Plan gaps have led to technology needs in support of high velocity penetrating weapons, air superiority, long range strike and high speed strike platforms, and future capability for functional defeat. RWM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (RWME), Fuzes Branch (RWMF), and Damage Mechanisms Branch (RWMW). RWME operates the High Explosives R&amp;amp;D (HERD) facility which is responsible for the development of energetic materials from concept formulation through pilot plant production for transition into existing or future inventory weapon systems. RWMF is responsible for the research and development of technologies to enable precision burst point control initiation of current and future weapon systems. Examples of precision burst point control include post-impact hard target intelligent fuzing and high-closing rate air-to-air and air-to-ground target imaging and aim point selection. RWMW interests range from a fundamental understanding of detonation and reaction processes for the formation of damage mechanisms (i.e., directed fragmentation fields, multi-phase blast) to ordnance system survivability and end-game performance (e.g. sled track verification and/or arena characterization for later lethality estimates). Specific research interests are in the shock response and equation of state for the damage mechanism materials, including inert, reactive, and explosives; relevant target materials and improved constitutive strength descriptions; fracture and fragmentation; penetration mechanics; and improving the suite of diagnostics to best extract the high-rate and violent environments of these ordnance systems. Current specific interests reside in multi-functional materials, such as those possessing structural benefits as well as contributing to the energy-on-target for the most efficient of weapon designs. Also desired are highly agile and end-game responsive adaptation to the weapon-on-target conditions; tailorable output that ensures optimal energy use while limiting collateral damage&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;STRATEGIC PLANNING AND INTEGRATION DIVISION (RWP)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Planning and Integration Division (RWP) is responsible for strategic planning. Strategic planning consists of overall RW investment planning; determining warfighter issues and requirements related to munitions and the transition opportunities for science and technology. RWP consists of the Capability Planning Branch (RWPB) and the Capability Integration Branch (RWPI).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;WEAPON ENGAGEMENT SCIENCES DIVISION (RWW)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Weapon Engagement Sciences Division (RWW) directs and conducts basic, exploratory, and advanced development research in weapon terminal seeker science and munitions aerodynamics, guidance navigation and control to include algorithms, processors, control loops, and airframes for affordable air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional munitions. Munitions Systems Effects Sciences area conducts research on a broad range of leading edge modeling and simulation activities that allows the evaluation of system level performance and effectiveness of advanced munitions concepts through high-fidelity, ground testing. Much of the technology focus is on autonomous precision-guided air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, with decreased susceptibility to counter measures, improved weather performance, enhanced utility, and decreased cost. The Division is comprised of the following organizational branches to conduct this mission: Computation Mechanics (RWWC), Integrated Guidance Simulations (RWWG), Integrated Sensing and Processing (RWWI), Lethality and Vulnerability (RWWL), Weapon Dynamics and Control Sciences (RWWN), Weapon Seeker Sciences (RWWS), and Munitions Aerodynamics Sciences (RWWV).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections. The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the 18 prospective research areas. These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munitions paradigms. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 1 - WEAPON AIRFRAME SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (RWWV)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Advances in weapon airframe systems technologies are required to take advantage of emerging developments in weapon guidance systems, networked information systems, and precision effect ordnance systems. The goal of this work is to perform research on technologies for development of agile weapon airframes that are capable of being deployed or dispensed from manned and unmanned platforms (e.g., 5th-6th generation fighters) and that are capable of delivering precision controlled effects against fixed and mobile ground targets and air targets in high uncertainty engagement scenarios. Enabling technologies in the following research areas are of interest: agile weapon airframes for all flight regimes; high agility airframes capable of aggressive but controlled post-stall flight maneuvers; robust, low-cost, compact control and actuation systems (aero and propulsive) for small weapons; composable/fractionable weapon systems; compact power for small weapons; small weapon design, carriage, and dispensing technology; and compressed carriage munitions. Airframe technology research efforts should have a sound basis in credible theories, principles and methodologies of dynamical systems, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, materials, propulsion, and flight mechanics; should exploit advances in other weapon technologies (e.g., advanced sensors and seekers, guidance and control algorithms, networked enabled weapons and information architectures, controlled effects ordnance, etc.); should be amenable to further development through sound principles of systems engineering; and should offer the potential for significantly improving affordable weapon aerial systems capabilities, effectiveness and reliabilities. In the context of this research area, innovative and novel concepts based upon emerging science and technology are encouraged; incremental evolution of existing technologies are of low interest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Dr. Michael Valentino &lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWV&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-2561&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 883-2538&lt;br /&gt;michael.valentino.1@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 2 - BIOPRINCIPIC SENSORS, INFORMATION PROCESSING, AND CONTROL (RWWI)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Both biological systems and smart munitions collect information on their own state and from the environment. These systems are able to process that information and make some decision. In the case of a seeker (eye), the information may include spatial, spectral, temporal, and possible polarization. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle guidance or navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary sensor concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Thus, RWWI is interested in sensors, information processing, and control methods that leverage understanding of concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in bioprincipics (the discipline of understanding and applying the principles on which biological systems work) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural sensors to build small and affordable autonomous munitions sensors. Sensors of interest include seekers, mechanosensors of various types and applications (including acoustic sensors), magnetosensors, and chemosensors. An integrated sensor design includes not only the hardware component, but the &quot;software&quot; or &quot;algorithm&quot; that does the information processing. We are interested in sparse sensing (compressive sensing) concepts, and analog and hybrid processing techniques when they show speed and accuracy advantages over pure digital processing. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Weapon Engagement Sciences Division.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. Nick Rummelt&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWI&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-0886&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-3344&lt;br /&gt;nicholas.rummelt@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 3 - AUTONOMOUS TARGET RECOGNITION (RWWI)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWWI is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: David Gray&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWI&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-0849 &lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-3344&lt;br /&gt;david.gray.20@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 4 - HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES (RWWG)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWWG is interested in developing advanced capabilities related to hardware-in-the-loop and digital simulation of guided weapon designs. RWWG exercises simulations to verify weapon performance, with particular emphasis on target acquisition, tracking, and guidance performance during terminal homing. Sensors and algorithms for Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Tactical Munitions subsystems developed within AFRL/RW are evaluated. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, millimeter-wave, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Emphasis for simulation technology research is placed on advancement and improvements to scene projection/projector technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, target phenomenology methods, simulation architectures, millimeter-wave simulators, cryogenic chamber simulator, wide field-of-view flight motion simulators, and high bandwidth motion simulators.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. Michael Deiler&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWG&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-1919&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-4128&lt;br /&gt;michael.deiler@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 5 - ADVANCED SCENE GENERATION (RWWG)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Integral to the development of advanced munitions programs is the capability at AFRL/RW to perform high fidelity simulation-based testing of munitions, components and systems. The current capability to generate synthetic imagery for high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm testing is based on a toolbox of independent Government and industry tools for predicting threat characteristics, environmental effects, and munitions hardware and software performance. The evolution in complexity and capability of modern weapons systems, however, is leading to demands for higher fidelity and performance from test simulations. In addition, the integrated nature of the modern battlefield requires test simulations to encompass not only the weapon itself, but also a variety of other systems. New scene generation (SG) techniques are needed in the areas of characterization of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Air Force threats, urban environments, chemical/biological effects, coupling and integration of scene generation software, multiple sensor views, and advanced computing techniques. These SG improvements must be designed to streamline the process for evaluating guided munitions concepts from initial design to final implementation, lowering development costs and shortening time from drawing board to battlefield. The improved testing realism will provide confidence that the munitions will perform as expected under a much wider variety of combat conditions than previously possible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. Charles Coker&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWG&lt;br /&gt;(850) 882-4629&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-4128&lt;br /&gt;charles.coker@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 6 - EO/IR/LADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH (RWWS)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWWS has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging electro-optic, infrared, and ladar systems. These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detectors and their readout integrated circuits, beam pointing/scanning and wide-field-of-view/multi-aperture techniques, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems. Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components operating in subsonic through hypersonic regimes. These include the following: Optical Sources: Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the long wavelength infrared (&amp;lt; 12 microns) are desired. Detector systems: Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to the long wavelength infrared range are desired. Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling. Beam pointing and beam scanning systems: Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired. Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired. Detection schemes: Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest. Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems: Systems that can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required. These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technical POC: Mr. James Savage&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWS&lt;br /&gt;(850) 882-4250 &lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-4260&lt;br /&gt;james.savage.2@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 7 - NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RWWN)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWWN is developing global positioning system (GPS) anti-jam technology, geo-referenced alternative to GPS navigation, control algorithms for agile autonomous micro air vehicles and micro munitions, vision-based guidance methodologies, control algorithms for path planning and task assignment of cooperative systems of munitions and air vehicles, track fusion and on-line state estimation methods for fusing target tracks between weapon platforms, methodologies for operators to supervise the time critical control of collections of cooperating air vehicles, small and low cost components for secure low probability of intercept data links on micro weapons, and network topologies and routing algorithms for small to large networks of munitions with line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Biologically inspired but mathematically rigorous techniques are being pursued for agile and vision-based guidance and control. Cooperative control methodologies currently emphasize integrated path planning and task assignment, hedging for un-modeled (adversarial induced) uncertainty, and information theoretic bounds on performance of cooperative networks. Data link technologies are needed that will yield extreme miniaturization while being compatible with current and future military tactical networks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Dr. Jess Curtis&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWN&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-2564&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850)882-0715 &lt;br /&gt;jess.curtis@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 8 - MODELING, SIMULATION, &amp;amp; ANALYSIS (MS&amp;amp;A) OF ADVANCED WEAPON CONCEPTS (RWWL)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of this work is to develop/modify and employ models used to analyze advanced weapon concepts and their related concepts of employment to highlight technologies worthy of consideration for investment. The objective is to apply, modify and/or combine engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, campaign (many-on-many, military worth), level modeling techniques, tools, and analysis methods as well as virtual and constructive digital simulation which lend themselves to the quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts. Concepts include, but are not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel damage mechanisms, lethal and novel destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery. Detailed modeling includes, but is not limited to, sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats. Scenario development and visualization at each level of MS&amp;amp;A is also sought. Research into new simulation toolsets and architectures designed for this purpose will also be considered. Additionally, environmental factors that influence a weapons performance can be considered. This can include but not be limited to urban environments, collaborative simulation environments, A2AD type environments, scenario generation and infrastructure simulation common to environments that weapons may operate in. Existing tools of interest include, but are not limited to, ESAMS, RADGUNS, MATLAB/Simulink, FLAMES, EADSIM, and STORM. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of MS&amp;amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be performed on-site (e.g. at the Government facility) and security clearances at the SECRET level will be required.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. Reed Young&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWL&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-2325&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-2563&lt;br /&gt;richard.young.26@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 9 - TARGET VULNERABILITY AND WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS (RWWL)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of this work is to collect data, conduct research, develop/modify and employ responsive modeling tools, target models, and processes as part of AFRL&apos;s R&amp;amp;D efforts. These efforts will identify potential vulnerabilities in targets and their subcomponents for conventional or concept weapons to exploit. They will also enable understanding and predictive capability for the effectiveness of inventory, developmental, and conceptual munitions when deployed against targets and critical components. Targets of interest can include but are not limited to mobile, fixed (above and below ground), hard and deeply buried, chem-bio and air-to-air. This research will allow development of new techniques or enhancement of existing techniques to measure and compare weapon effectiveness, collateral damage, and potential collateral hazards. Research will include improvements in our ability to predict and measure component vulnerability and functional defeat allowing assessment of weapon effects that degrade a target&apos;s ability to perform its intended functions without necessarily destroying it. It could also include research and modeling of new or conceptual damage mechanisms. Development of new target and associated functional models as well as advanced methodologies to capture the physics of structural response to conventional weapon effects would improve our abilities to assess current and conceptual weapons and ways to exploit high interest targets or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Research to enhance or develop methodology to account for the target critical equipment/components, and their interconnections, and associated failure logic and failure modes could be required. Tools of interest include, but are not limited to AJEM, ARM, BLASTX, BRL-CAD, Endgame Framework, FastCD, FASTGEN, FATEPEN, IMEA, JWS, CUSP, ORCA, PENCURV, PDAM, STMG, VALUE, WEAPS, and WinBLAST. In addition, to the existing toolset, new methods for integrating high-fidelity computational physics capability while minimizing CPU and/or clock time would provide enhanced predictive proficiency. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of weapon testing, experimentation and weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability MS&amp;amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be classified. Approved classified processing capabilities and security clearances at the SECRET level as a minimum will be required.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. Eric Scarborough&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWL&lt;br /&gt;Ph: (850) 883-5419&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-2563&lt;br /&gt;eric.scarborough.2@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 10 - WEAPON/TARGET MECHANICS (RWWC)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The performance assessment and development of advanced conventional weapon systems requires the capabilities to model complex weapon/target interaction phenomena and to predict environments produced by impacting, penetrating, and detonating warheads. Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models. Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, modeling the shock survivability of fuze electronic components, predictive models for the change in material properties due to thermal cycling (energetics and electronics), fragmentation, mesoscale modeling (metals and energetics), localized shear band formation, high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, equation of state and constitutive models for chemical and biological agents, numerical modeling of neutralization mechanisms for biological and chemical agents, hydrodynamic ram, atomization and aerosolization of chemical and biological agents, direct numerical simulation of detonations, coupled detonation physics and multi-phase flow, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales, and advanced numerical methods. Innovative theoretical, computational and experimental projects that specifically address the problems of interest and result in an improved predictive capability are the goal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Dr. Kirk Vanden &lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWC &lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-2658 &lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-2201 &lt;br /&gt;kirk.vanden@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 11 - DAMAGE MECHANISMS RESEARCH (RWMW)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWMW is interested in all aspects of conventional munitions warhead technology as it relates to the destruction, damage, defeat, or denial of function. Technologies and concepts are sought for a robust and affordable capability of air-launched munitions in the areas of: hard and deeply buried targets, fixed ground targets, mobile ground vehicles, air dominance, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) neutralization or access denial, and cyber net neutralization. Specific research interests are in the shock response and equation of state for the damage mechanism materials, including inert, reactive, and explosives; relevant target materials and improved constitutive strength descriptions; fracture and fragmentation; penetration mechanics; and improving the suite of diagnostics to best extract the high-rate and violent environments of these ordnance systems. Current specific interests reside in multi-functional materials, such as those possessing structural benefits as well as contributing to the energy-on-target for the most efficient of weapon designs. Ordnance package integration and optimized system response of shared capabilities is of interest. Also desired are highly agile and end-game responsive adaptation to the weapon-on-target conditions and tailorable output that ensures optimal energy use while limiting collateral damage. Novel concepts of target defeat are encouraged to augment or replace the more traditional kinetic energy methods.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. Matthew Matyac&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWMW&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-0005&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 883-1380&lt;br /&gt;matthew.matyac@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 12 - FUZE RESEARCH (RWMF)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWMF develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies that have application to fuzes for air-delivered weapons, including, but not limited to, guided and unguided bombs, missiles, and submunitions. Fuzes must reliably remain in a safe mode until the appropriate post-deployment environments (such as freefall) are sensed; the fuze must then arm the weapon and, upon receiving a signal from a target detection device (TDD), initiate the explosive fill (or other damage mechanism). RWMF thus seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can be integrated into the design or testing of air-delivered weapon fuzes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWMF is particularly interested in fuzes (including submunition fuzes) and related component or material technologies that are capable of surviving the repetitive, multi-axis shock environment experienced by a fuze during penetration of a hardened target and functioning the warhead. Materials that mitigate all or some portion of the shock spectrum are also of interest. Unique inertial detection devices or non-inertial detection devices are of interest. However, current test technologies do not fully duplicate the multi-axial fuze environment in terms of duration, repetitive high-acceleration loading, and other aspects of the mechanical loading profile. This necessitates extremely expensive sled tests for fuze research, testing, qualification, and performance evaluation. Therefore, there is interest in laboratory and field test techniques and equipment to duplicate these repetitive, multi-axial shocks. Additional penetration fuzing-specific research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;- Develop a jam-resistant, greater than 250 kilobits/second shock-hardened wireless Data Link for two-way communication with a fuze during a weapon&apos;s deep underground penetration event;&lt;br /&gt;- Develop a hardened, passive, unpowered, tri-axial device that irreversibly and measurably changes some physical configuration or property without relaxation/hysteresis to record the peak acceleration as a back-up data point for tests when a hardened fuze data recorder fails;&lt;br /&gt;- Develop a low-cost (&amp;lt;$100), shock-hardened accelerometer;&lt;br /&gt;- Develop non-inertial techniques and appropriate devices for detecting voids and layers during hard target penetration; and&lt;br /&gt;- Develop miniature, shock hardened transmitter and antenna to burst stored digital data upon command to retrieve post event recorded data from a buried warhead. It would also be useful for the purpose of locating a test item.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWMF is also interested in improved sensors, techniques, and/or systems for second safety environment sensing (as defined in Mil-Std-1316) for gravity released general-purpose bombs. For example, an improvement or replacement for the FZU-32, -48, etc., would be of significant interest. In the area of miniature and micro-munition fuzing, research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;- Reliable miniature three port air valve with a temperature operating range of -55 to +&lt;br /&gt;75 degree C&lt;br /&gt;- Ground profiling fuze sensor technology&lt;br /&gt;- Active imaging aimpoint selecting fuze sensor technology&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The final area of focused interest is in the area of in-line and out-of-line initiation systems. RWMF Advanced Initiation Science group is interested in novel ignition devices or ignition circuitry that can enhance reliability while reducing energy budgets for initiation systems. Additionally, concepts that would enable novel warhead designs are of interest. We are also interested in novel or more inherently robust manufacturing processes that can be applied to components within initiation systems. Finally, there is interest in modeling and simulation methods or techniques for characterizing performance of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. George Jolly &lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWMF&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-0587&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-2707&lt;br /&gt;george.jolly.1@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 13 - MUNITIONS ENERGETIC MATERIALS (RWME)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Munitions Energetic Materials is concerned with (1) the formulation, manufacturing, and producibility; (2) the characterization and phenomenology; and (3) the theoretical energetics and design for explosives and energetic materials for munition applications. This topic includes development of explosive formulations to address impact, thermal, and vibration survivability; energetic materials, including nanometric explosives with higher energy density than traditional explosives. Reactive materials comprising metastable interstitial composites (MICs) and/or metal fuels in combination with oxidizers and explosives are also included. Use of computational tools to predict formulation properties, including survivability and processing, is of interest. Constitutive modeling of these materials, including mesoscale descriptions of their dynamic mechanical response, initiation mechanisms and reactive equations of state are included as well. Novel approaches for formulating, processing, enhancing the mechanical properties (i.e., strength, toughness) and characterizing the special features of energetic materials and functionally graded materials in terms of their performance and energy release benefits are also of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Dr. C.

This work will require facilities with the capability to work with energetic nano materials that may also be classified as an explosive. These new RW facilities and equipment will enable world class research, development, integration, fabrication and testing of future prototype munitions system concepts demonstrating emerging micro munition and advanced energetics technologies. Developing concepts and preliminary designs for these new and unique facilities as well as for much of the new equipment to be used in these facilities will need to be approached as research and development projects, not as just design projects. New control/monitoring techniques and equipment will be required to simultaneously meet HVAC requirements for working with nano materials that are also an explosive especially in areas where a clean room environment is required. Of particular interest are proposals for preliminary feasibility studies; concept development, assessment, evaluation, preliminary design and associated cost estimates/presentation material for the new facilities and/or new research equipment that will be required to pursue this evolution of energetics from conventional explosives to reactive materials and nano energetics and munitions from the current conventional munitions to micro munitions. Also of interest are proposals for structural response calculations/modeling, design analysis, and design needed to support Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) submittals/presentations required for explosives siting approval of new facilities to be located at one of RW&apos;s remote explosives locations. This topic includes work to advance the understanding of nano energetic material effects on both the human body and the environment as well as work relating to the understanding, interpretation, and assessment of present and likely future applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements/regulations that would relate to nano energetics. A need is anticipated for developing new systems/components that will enable the new facilities and equipment to meet these emerging future requirements/regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Facilities POC: Ms. Jaime Pinto Technical POC: Mr Charles (Tom) Sprague &lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWOL AFRL/RWME&lt;br /&gt;(850) 882-3918 (850) 882-4482&lt;br /&gt;jaime.pinto@us.af.mil charles.sprague@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESEARCH AREA 15 - MULTI-FUNCTION, MULTI-MODE RADAR RESEARCH (RWWS)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RWWS is looking to sponsor research on innovative radar frequency (RF) component and system technologies and associated software to offer improved performance or reduction in Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP). Future multifunction radars will need to provide a wide range of sensory and communications functions. These functions may include altimeter, navigation-aiding, communication &lt;br /&gt;(1-way or 2-way datalink), midcourse guidance, target selection and non-target rejection, terminal tracking, and Guidance Integrated Fuzing (GIF) and aimpoint selection. The radar would require the ability to track moving and stationary targets, and would employ Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), High Range Resolution (HRR), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS), and endgame target engagement. The general radar integrating concept would be of a software defined radio which could transmit and receive signals from distributed apertures over various center frequencies and bandwidths to accomplish the desired objectives. Any hardware or software system or subsystem would require associated software models for integration into Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) and Software-In-The-Loop (SWIL) simulations to evaluate the merits of the proposed components, subsystems, and/or systems. Target applications could include submunition seekers small enough to be incorporated into a larger munition and dispensed to engage multiple targets in a target-rich environment, as well as nose-mounted gimbaled and/or body-fixed including conformally mounted apertures for a munition body ranging in diameter from 2.75&quot; to 14&quot; or more. Technologies should consider compatibility with wide bandwidth waveforms including noise-like waveforms for minimum interference to other radars. The desire is to extend operating range in adverse weather and to handle high speed environments and the temperature extremes of high altitude cold-soak and the aerodynamic heating associated with hypersonic speeds. Special emphasis should be place on engaging targets in a steep dive trajectory where the target will have minimal range separation from the clutter background. Note that all hardware and software subsystems/systems should address the ability to function in a real-time processing environment consistent with real-time target engagement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Mr. Tom Lewis&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWS&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-8101&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-1717&lt;br /&gt;thomas.lewis.12@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 16 - REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH (RW)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This research area is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interest to this Directorate. AFRL/RW is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new airframe, ordnance, and guidance and control technology weapon paradigms. A goal of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets. Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches - lethal and novel - to defeat these targets. With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The military payoff would be in terms of significant munitions weight and size reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness. Novel warhead approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced loss of life and/or different defeat mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another goal of this research area is to develop highly innovative concepts and approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions. This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;amp;C) of munitions airframes will also be sought. The basic seeker technologies to be considered include: sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. The basic GN&amp;amp;C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms. In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be developed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Dr. Mikel Miller&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWPB&lt;br /&gt;(850) 882-3003&lt;br /&gt;joseph.letsinger@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH AREA 17 - SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) for EDUCATION OUTREACH (RW)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;AFRL/RW seeks proposals in support of education outreach programs in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The Department of Defense (DoD) mission of STEM is to: foster an interest in, raise awareness, and study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics nationwide to ensure an educated and well-prepared workforce, which meets the DoD and national competitive needs. In support of this mission, the following goals have been identified:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Inspire students, parents, teachers, and the public to engage in STEM discovery and innovation. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Engage students and teachers in STEM-related hands-on learning activities.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Educate students to be well-prepared for higher education and employment in STEM disciplines. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Employ, retain and develop STEM professionals.

Stipends for teachers undertaking professional training in connection with these activities may be supported as well as funding for the acquisition of materials and resources needed to launch, implement, assess, and improve the STEM oriented programs. AFRL encourages the projects and program results to be published in appropriate publications and academic journals at the end of the period of performance. Participants are encouraged to develop innovative approaches that utilize their unique assets, capabilities, locations, and personnel.

Novel bio-inspired sensing and wide-field of view seeker hardware are desired to create improved situational awareness as well as improved integrated sensing-control algorithms. Test and evaluation hardware and scene generation technology are also desired for distributed aperture and wide-field sensing. Limited communication in contested environments might require decentralized, high-level cognitive functions: technologies that enable context-aware reasoning, multi-agent coordination, graceful performance degradation, and inherently flexible or reconfigurable operation are highly desired. Unified architectures or mathematical languages applicable to the control and coordination of heterogeneous information services and that enable verifiable, trusted autonomy are also sought. Network-aware capabilities, especially technology that cognitively matches machines with human oversight, would enable trusted cooperation and increased capacity for autonomous weapon deployment. Finally, science and technology that allows for fractionated weapon performance (having capability spread across multiple assets that coordinate to deliver a desired effect) and composable functions (where disparate capabilities can be combined synergistically to create multiple desired effects) are also of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technical POC: Dr. Jess Willard Curtis&lt;br /&gt;AFRL/RWWN&lt;br /&gt;(850) 883-2564&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-3344&lt;br /&gt;jess.curtis@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;II.

However, similarly, all offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. Anticipated Type of Awards: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed. A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA as appropriate. We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;C. Evaluation and Award (Applicable to Both Basic Open BAA and BAA Call): Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and awards made, without discussions unless discussions are determined to be necessary. However, the Government may obtain clarifications to determine proposal acceptability. Discussions may be held with prospective awardees prior to award if needed. In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. Offerors are cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A. Eligible Offeror/Applicants: This is an unrestricted solicitation. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all or any part of this solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. Foreign-owned Firms: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point identified in Section VII for information if they contemplate responding. The subject line of all correspondence must reference the BAA number, title, and associated research area.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;C. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers: The following guidance is provided for Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) contemplating submitting a proposal, as either a prime or subcontractor, against this BAA. FAR 35.017-1(c)(4) prohibits an FFRDC from competing with any non-FFRDC concern in response to a Federal agency request for proposal for other than the operation of an FFRDC (with exceptions stated in DFARS 235.017-1(c)(4)). There is no regulation prohibiting an FFRDC from responding to a solicitation. However, the FFRDC&apos;s sponsoring agency must first make a determination that the effort being proposed falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC, and that determination must be included in the FFRDC&apos;s proposal. In addition, the non-sponsoring agency must make a determination that the work proposed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry. Only after these determinations are made would a determination be made concerning the FFRDC&apos;s eligibility to receive an award.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;D. Government Agencies: If a Government agency is interested in performing work, offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point identified in Section VII for information if they contemplate responding. If those discussions result in a mutual interest to pursue your agency&apos;s participation, the effort will be pursued independent of this announcement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;E. Cost Sharing or Matching: Cost sharing is not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;IV. BASIC OPEN BAA SECTION&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A. WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Application Package: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION and WE ARE SOLICITING WHITE PAPERS ONLY. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Those offerors whose white papers are found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may later be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal (see Section VI of this announcement for further details). Offeror&apos;s white papers not selected may contact the technical POC for feedback on their submission. Debriefings will not be offered for white papers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Content and Form of Submission of White Papers: Offerors are required to submit either 1 electronic copy or 2 paper copies of a white paper that is 5 pages or less summarizing their proposed approach/solution. Any pages over the stated 5 page maximum will not be evaluated. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The format for the white paper is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;a. Page Format:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A. Paper Size - 8.5 inch x 11 inch&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. Margins - one-inch on each page&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;C. Font - no smaller than12 pitch, to include tables, diagrams, and charts.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;D. Double spaced&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;b. Document Format:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Section A: Title, White Paper in response to Research Area Number (identify #), Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email) (this section is NOT included in the page count).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Section B: Task Objective.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Section D: Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;c. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by an offeror. If an offeror wishes to restrict access to his/her white paper, it must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 52.215-1(e). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA-RWK-2014-0001 with their submission.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Funding Restrictions: The cost of preparing white papers/subsequent proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in &lt;br /&gt;FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Other Submission Requirements: If the offeror chooses to submit white papers in hard copy, they must be submitted directly to the contract specialist at the address at paragraph VII(B). Documents should reference BAA-RWK-2014-0001, a technical topic, and the name listed as a Technical POC for that Research Area. In lieu of 2 hard copies, electronic submissions may be sent to the Contracting Office at afrl.rwk.baaworkflow@us.af.mil.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. WHITE PAPER / PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. White Paper Evaluation Criteria: The following two factors will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The following factors are listed in descending order of importance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Evaluation Criteria:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;a. Factor 1: An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the three AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 18 research areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;b. Factor 2: ROM commensurate with technical approach.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Proposal Evaluation Criteria: If white paper is selected for further consideration, the following 4 Factors, listed in descending order of importance (cost/price, although ranked 4th, is a substantial factor), will be used to determine if a contract is to be awarded:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Evaluation Criteria:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;a. Factor 1: An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the three AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 18 research areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;b. Factor 2: The offeror&apos;s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the formal proposal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;c. Factor 3: The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed objectives presented in the formal proposal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;d. Factor 4: The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk for technical, cost, and schedule will be assessed for formal proposals, should they be requested, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror&apos;s proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror&apos;s proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance. Risk Drivers and Risk Mitigation are not necessarily part of Research Area 16, Revolutionary Research. Risk may be assessed as High; Moderate, or Low; however, high risk, revolutionary ideas that change paradigms are sought.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;High: Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Moderate: Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Low: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Review and Selection Process: The evaluation described above will generally result in proposals being placed in one of the three categories below:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;a. Category I: Demonstrates technical merit. Is important to agency programs. The offeror presents relevant experience and access to adequate resources. Risk is acceptable. The cost/price is reasonable and realistic. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;b. Category II: Demonstrates technical merit; is important to agency programs; and presents relevant experience and access to adequate resources; but requires further development. Risk is acceptable. The cost/price is reasonable and realistic. Category II proposals are recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;c. Category III: Does not demonstrate technical merit; does not meet agency needs; does not present adequate experience or resources; the risk level is unacceptable; or the cost/price is not reasonable or realistic.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;C. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Award Notices (White Papers): Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this Basic Open BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Officer. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 60 calendar days after submission.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Award Notices (full proposals): Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;V. CALLS BAA SECTION&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Periodically, proposal call announcements (CALLS) may be issued in FedBizOps under BAA-RWK-2014-0001 to request proposals for Armament Technology topic areas. This is a one-step process and NO WHITE PAPER will be requested, PROPOSALS ONLY. These subsequent CALLS will contain specific objectives and descriptions of the specific topic area to be addressed, anticipated period of performance, information peculiar to the specific topic area, and the expected dollar range for proposals received under the CALL. Proposals in response to the CALL BAA will be accepted as specified in the actual CALL.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Content and Form of Submission of Proposals: Proposal format, due dates and times will be specified in each CALL. Proposals received after the due date and time specified in the CALL shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Offerors MUST monitor FedBizOps https://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended or CALLS are issued. Offerors must monitor these systems to ensure they receive the maximum proposal preparation time for subsequent amendments as this is the official notification vehicle to request proposals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Communications: Prospective offerors may contact the technical points of contact to verify interest in the effort to be proposed PRIOR to committing any resources to the preparation of any proposals in response to a CALL under this announcement. Discussions shall not include content or rating information of other offeror&apos;s proposals or White Papers. Discussions with the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Questions outside the scope of the technical focal point, such as contract terms or conditions, or projected award schedule, should be referred to the Contracting Officer. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Estimated Program Cost: Each CALL will contain funding profiles specific to that effort. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Funding Restrictions: The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Proposal Evaluation Criteria: The following 4 Factors, listed in descending order of importance (cost/price, although ranked 4th, is a substantial factor), will be used to determine if a contract is to be awarded:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Evaluation Criteria:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;a. Factor 1: An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the three AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 18 research areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;b. Factor 2: The offeror&apos;s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, and combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the formal proposal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;c. Factor 3: The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed objectives presented in the formal proposal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;d. Factor 4: The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk for technical, cost, and schedule will be assessed for formal proposals, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror&apos;s proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror&apos;s proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance. Risk may be assessed as High, Moderate, or Low.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;High: Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance.

Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Low: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Review and Selection Process: The evaluation described above will generally result in proposals being placed in one of the three categories below:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;a. Category I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;b. Category II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;c. Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all proposals as privileged information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Those selected as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal. Should portions of a proposal be incorporated into a resulting contract, that portion may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act unless exempt from release.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. AWARD NOTICES: Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;VI. TERMS APPLICABLE TO ALL BAA AWARDS:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A. Administrative and National Policy Requirements: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. Reporting: Contractors should expect any contract or assistance instrument resulting from this BAA would contain the requirement to provide various types of periodic and final technical reports, and possibly cost and other reports.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;C. Data Rights Assertions: It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights; however different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The contractor shall identify data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc. that apply to any proprietary materials, technical data, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime or subcontractor(s) in the performance of this program; and shall address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to any contracts awarded under this BAA. Any data delivered or anticipated to be delivered with less than unlimited rights must be reported in a separate, appropriately marked appendix to the final report of any awarded contract resulting from this BAA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;D. Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) and Voluntary Protection Program (VPP): Eglin AFB is in the process of pursuing recognition under the OSHA VPP. If required as a part of a resulting contract from this BAA, AFFARS 5352.223-9001 mandates that adequate health and safety requirements be identified in the contract. Contractors can gain more information regarding the OSHA VPP Program at &lt;br /&gt;http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/vpp/index.html.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;VII. AGENCY CONTACTS&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A. Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the technical point of contact listed in Section I Research Areas, above.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. Questions of a contractual/business nature shall be directed to the contract specialist:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sonia Martinez&lt;br /&gt;101 W. Eglin Blvd Ste. 337&lt;br /&gt;Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (850) 883-2678&lt;br /&gt;Email: sonia.martinez.1@us.af.mil&lt;br /&gt;Fax: (850) 882-9599&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Note: Any correspondence should reference the BAA title, number, and research area in the Subject Line.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;C. In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9103, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer listed above for resolution. &lt;br /&gt;AFFARS 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The Ombudsman is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Barbara Gehrs&lt;br /&gt;Director of Contracting (AFRL/PK)&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (937) 904-4407&lt;br /&gt;Email: barbara.gehrs@us.af.mil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A. Support Contractors: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as &quot;handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks.&quot; These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;amp;D case files;&lt;br /&gt;2. Accessing library files for use by Government personnel; and&lt;br /&gt;3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;B. Communication: Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;C. Debriefings (Proposals Only): When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Effective 1 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;E. Item Identification and Valuation: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Unique Identification and Valuation (Dec 2013), which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government&apos;s unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government&apos;s unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government&apos;s unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, &quot;the Government&apos;s unit acquisition cost is the contractor&apos;s estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items&quot; (per DoD, &quot;fully burdened unit costs&quot; to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html. The contract will also include DFARS 252.211-7007, Reporting of Government-Furnished Property (Aug 2012).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements: If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) and Forward Pricing Rate Recommendations (FPRRs) should submit them with their proposals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;G. Pre-Award Clearance: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program&apos;s (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP&apos;s National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward. This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be &quot;in compliance&quot; within the past 2 years with the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;H. Limitations on Pass-Through Charges: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at FAR 52.215-23, Limitations on Pass-Through Charges (Oct 2009), which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor&apos;s indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor&apos;s indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I. Associate Contractor Agreements: Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on Government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The Contracting Officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate Government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the Contracting Officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;J.

Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Moderate: Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Low: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2.

Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Moderate: Some related experience, but no experience directly associated with this technology. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Low: Significant relevant experience directly associated with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the formal proposal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Exceeds the criteria (Address key aspects of the proposal which demonstrate why the proposal exceeds the criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meets the criteria (Address key aspects of the proposal which demonstrate why the proposal meets the criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Does not meet the criteria (Address key aspects of the proposal which demonstrate why the proposal does not meet the criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Strengths&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Assessed Proposal Risk: High _____ Moderate _____ Low _____&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;High: No significant qualifications, capabilities, and experience of key personnel. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Moderate: Breadth of qualifications, capabilities, and experience of key personnel is lacking in technologies. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Low: Key personnel possess qualifications and experience required and exhibit critical capabilities to perform this effort.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;(Check all that apply) &lt;br /&gt;The offeror&apos;s proposed: (1) quantity and mix of labor hours, (2) material, (3) subcontracting, (4) travel, and (5) any other direct costs, are appropriate and realistic for their proposed technical approach.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Assessed Proposal Risk: High _____ Moderate _____ Low _____&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;High: Cost proposed, labor mix and number of hours does not reflect that the Contractor has a clear understanding of the effort required to achieve technical objectives. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Moderate: Indicators exists that additional labor categories or hours may be required to complete the technical effort.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Low: Cost proposed, labor mix and number of hours reflect that the Contractor has a clear understanding of the effort required to achieve technical objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Category Ranking: ________________&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The evaluation described above will generally result in proposals being placed in one of the three categories below:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;a. Category I: Demonstrates technical merit. Is important to agency programs. The offeror presents relevant experience and access to adequate resources. Risk is acceptable. The cost/price is reasonable and realistic. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;b. Category II: Demonstrates technical merit; is important to agency programs; and presents relevant experience and access to adequate resources; but requires further development. Risk is acceptable. The cost/price is reasonable and realistic. Category II proposals are recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;c. Category III: Does not demonstrate technical merit; does not meet agency needs; does not present adequate experience or resources; the risk level is unacceptable; or the cost/price is not reasonable or realistic.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Contracting Office Address: &lt;br /&gt;101 West Eglin Blvd&lt;br /&gt;Suite 337&lt;br /&gt;Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Primary Point of Contact: &lt;br /&gt;Sonia Martinez,&lt;br /&gt;Contract Specialist&lt;br /&gt;sonia.martinez.1@us.af.mil&lt;br /&gt;Phone: 850-883-2678&lt;br /&gt;Fax: 850-882-9599&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Secondary Point of Contact: &lt;br /&gt;Barbara Kopec,&lt;br /&gt;Contracting Officer&lt;br /&gt;barbara.kopec@us.af.mil&lt;br /&gt;Phone: 850-882-4296&lt;br /&gt;Fax: 850-882-9599&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;DISTRIBUTION A.

      "description": "This effort is an open-ended BAA soliciting innovative research concepts for the overall mission of the Human-Centered Intelligence, Surveillance, &amp;amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) Division (711 HPW/RHX). It is intended to generate research concepts not already defined and planned by RHX as part of its core S&amp;amp;T portfolio.\r\n&lt;p&gt;The core RHX mission is to develop human-centered S&amp;amp;T that (1) enables the Air Force to better identify, locate and track humans within the ISR environment and (2) enhance the performance of ISR analysts. To accomplish this mission, the RHX core S&amp;amp;T portfolio is structured into three major research areas:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;(1) Human Signatures - develop technologies to sense and exploit human bio-signatures at the molecular and macro (anthropometric) level,&lt;br /&gt;(2) Human Trust and Interaction - develop technologies to improve human-to-human interactions as well as human-to-machine interactions, and&lt;br /&gt;(3) Human Analyst Augmentation - develop technologies to enhance ISR analyst performance and to test the efficacy of newly developed ISR technologies within a simulated operational environment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The RHX mission also includes research carried over from the Airman Biosciences and Performance Program. While not directly linked to the core S&amp;amp;T strategic plan, there exists a unique capability resident within RHX to address critical Air Force operational and sustainment needs resulting from chemical and biological hazards. Research areas include contamination detection, hazard assessment and management, individual and collective protection, and restoration and reconstitution of operational capability.&lt;/p&gt;",
