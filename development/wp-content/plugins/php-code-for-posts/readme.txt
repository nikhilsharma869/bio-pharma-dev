Add PHP code to your WordPress posts, pages, custom post types and even sidebars using shortcodes

== Description ==

PHP Code for posts allows you to add your own PHP code to posts, pages, custom post types (posts) and even sidebars without the need for custom templates

The plugin enables a shortcode and options page so you can add your code to the admin options page and then output it in your post using shortcodes

Multiple code snippets can be used on a post, and multiple posts can use the same code snippet, allowing you to re-use code.

The shortcodes can be used to also display plain HTML content, allowing you to add in iframe, objects, areas and other tags that are removed by the post editor

The plugin also contains a variable array which you can add variables to for use between snippets called $_var and is available though the global variable $PHPPC which is an object, so its $PHPPC->_vars[]

= New for 1.1.1 =
The plugin's shortcode can also accept parameters using the param attribute, the value should be a string of name=value pairs, separated by &s, for example `[php snippet=2 param="var1=val1&var2=val2"]`.  Within your snippet, the parameters are assigned a $_parameters array, for example `echo $_parameters["var1"]; //outputs "val1"`

= New for 1.2.0 =
The plugin's snippet editor now has better formatting, and supports AJAX saving for snippet updates (request by eneasgesing)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= You mentioned a variable array to assign variables to for use between snippets, how do I do this? =

To assign variables to the array, use the following code:
` global $PHPPC;
  $PHPPC->$_vars["myvaridentifier"] = $myvar;`

and to read a variable from the array use this code:
` global $PHPPC;
	$myvar = $PHPPC->$_vars["myvaridentifer"];`
Simples!

= AJAX update keeps failing =

One of the main causes of a failed AJAX update is because nothing has actually changed in any of the fields.

= My snippet doesn't work =

One common error is an error in the eval'ed code, this is more down to a syntax / parse error in the php snippet, rather than the plugin it self.

= No other questions yet! =
