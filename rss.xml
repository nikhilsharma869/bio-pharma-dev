Quality link-building in German Language sites

I need an experienced quality link builder that can provide me 150 anchor text, one way links, with NO nofollow attribute done on a monthly basis for the next 6 months. By the end of the six months, the worker must have published 900 anchor text links. The kind of links I need must be of the type that doesn’t get deleted becaus e the site’s editor, webmaster or moderator considers it spam. This is the reason why I include the word “quality” in my description. I expect the links to be published within a favourable context, that means, published only in German-language pages that are related to the theme in at least one of the keywords contained in the 2 sets of keywords (keywords are specified in the lists called “1st set of keywords” and “2nd set of keywords”).

• The published links must be well distributed over each month (no massive publishing in any given day), that means 5 to 8 links per day. 
• Not more than 3 links should be published in the same domain name in any given month. 
• Not more than 3 times the same anchor text combination should be used in any given month. 
• Links must be published in pages that can be organically found by search engines (visible by search engines without any login required) and only in pages whose main page (that is, the url’s index page) has a Page Rank of at least 2 (no spam, keyword stuffed websites please). 
Payment will be done on a monthly basis but bidding will be done for the full 6 months period. That means that the winning bid, divided by 6, will be the monthly payment (Monthly payment = Winning bid / 6).
Please only bid after fully reviewing the full description document. You must be sure you can fulfil the job in a professional and diligent way. I will not consider bids from workers with a score below 9 or with fewer than 10 completed jobs.</description><link>http://projects.scriptfirm.com/freelancerclone/project-dtl.php?id=1327475899</link><pubDate>Wednesday 25th of January 2012 02:18:19 AM</pubDate><category>Graphic Design , C/C++ , HTML, xHTML , Blogs , Ecommerce Website </category></item><item><title>Application Development - Game DevelopmenT</title><description>We are interested in developing a version of the classic snake game in a free and premium version.<br /><br />

Since then it has grown to be the largest self-hosted blogging tool in the world, used on millions of sites and seen by tens of millions of people every day.

Everything you see here, from the documentation to the code itself, was created by and for the community. WordPress is an Open Source project, which means there are hundreds of people all over the world working on it. (More than most commercial platforms.) It also means you are free to use it for anything from your cat’s home page to a Fortune 500 web site without paying anyone a license fee and a number of other important freedoms.

About WordPress.org
On this site you can download and install a software script called WordPress. To do this you need a web host who meets the minimum requirements and a little time. WordPress is completely customizable and can be used for almost anything. There is also a service called WordPress.com which lets you get started with a new and free WordPress-based blog in seconds, but varies in several ways and is less flexible than the WordPress you download and install yourself.

What You Can Use WordPress For
WordPress started as just a blogging system, but has evolved to be used as full content management system and so much more through the thousands of plugins, widgets, and themes, WordPress is limited only by your imagination. (And tech chops.)</description><link>http://projects.scriptfirm.com/freelancerclone/project-dtl.php?id=1327475272</link><pubDate>Wednesday 25th of January 2012 02:07:52 AM</pubDate><category>Ajax , C/C++ , PHP , Blogs , Web Design , Website Makeover </category></item><item><title>OScommerce Project</title><description>Although osCommerce is still in its development stage, the available Milestone releases are considered to be stable with the following features:
